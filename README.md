## ðŸŒ± About Cannabis Data

Cannabis Data is an incubator for projects which serve the fresh flowering of humanity's relationships with the plant Cannabis and its many cultivars (medical, CBD, adult-use, and hemp).

## Getting Started

You can clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cannabisdata/cannabisdata.git
```

And then install all of the dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

You're then off to the races! The [contributing](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [publishing](./docs/publishing.md) guides can help you with more details on how to develop and publish the Cannabis Data dashboard. Once setup, you can run the dashboard locally with:

```shell
npm run dashboard:start
```

Stage the dashboard:

```shell
npm run dashboard:stage
```

And publish the dashboard:

```shell
npm run dashboard:publish
```

You now have a simple, yet complex, dashboard designed specifically to analyze large-scale cannabis data, that will automatically scale to handle your demands. You can now populate your Cannabis Data dashboard and analyze your data to your heart's content!
